# Shiny Without a Server: webR & Shinylive

## Presented at Jumping Rivers Shiny in Production 2023 Conference

These slides should be built using Quarto.

The resulting web-based presentation loads webR into the page several times to demonstrate different use cases. As such, note that the resulting download size is rather large.
